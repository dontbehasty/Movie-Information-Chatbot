# Movie-Information-Chatbot
In December 2019 - January 2020 I trained in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Essentials.
It was 3 week course delivered by Neueda, developing skills in Python, Data Preparation, Data and Cloud Platforms, Building and Deploying Chatbots. As part of this course I had to develop a chatbot using the technology and skills learned during training.
